#MESC Expitaxial Surface Characterisation

This is a collection of MATLAB code snippets that allow to characertise an epitaxially grown surface based on AFM or STM measurements. 
It calculates Various properties, such as correlation length or surface roughness.

At the moment it is still under work, and we do not know how well or even if it will run with different setups by now, since some parameter settings are very sensitive. Up to now, it is only known to work with iron based alloys grown in a MBE.
